### This repo is an open source repository that focuses on suggestions on how to reproduce the behaviour of the observed UFO. 


According to witnesses and footage, here are some deduction how they UFO works.

Red orange glow - ionized helium creates red orangish plasma. if helium loses one of its electrons and becomes a helium ion (He+), it will have a net positive charge. The positive charge of the helium ion can attract nearby electrons from other atoms or particles, as electrons are negatively charged. This phenomenon is often observed in plasma physics, where ions and electrons interact.

Wible effect - why the disc shaped UFO moves in a wible effect while staying in place ? When hit with electrons from all direction it basically levitates but hit at radom spots aspecially if high conductor is inside the craft.

If the atoms around the craft lose their electrons it might result in different effects for a moving craft.

Some additional information following up on comments:

External Effects of an Engulfed in plasma aircraft:

Drag Reduction: The plasma surrounding the aircraft may interact with the airflow, potentially reducing aerodynamic drag. The ionized helium plasma could create a localized boundary layer effect, leading to smoother airflow over the aircraft's surfaces, thereby reducing drag and increasing overall speed.

Ionization Interaction: The ionized helium plasma could interact with the surrounding air molecules, potentially altering their behavior. This interaction might result in changes to air density.

Once we start talking about a craft engulfed in plasma, the shape of the craft starts to play an additional role like plasma containment.

Disk-shaped advantages explanation:

Aerodynamic Efficiency: A disk shape can offer low drag and streamlined characteristics. The symmetrical nature of a disk can reduce frontal area, potentially enhancing aerodynamic efficiency and minimizing drag forces.

Plasma Containment: The circular shape could aid in containing the plasma within the aircraft's envelope. The absence of sharp edges or corners may help maintain a more stable plasma boundary, reducing the likelihood of plasma leakage or dispersion.

Structural Integrity: A disk shape can offer structural stability, particularly in terms of distributing forces evenly across the aircraft. The circular design may provide inherent strength and resistance to bending moments, making it potentially advantageous for structural integrity under the influence of plasma and high-speed flight.

The most difficult question to answer is the g-force felt internally that unless experimented no one can tell. We also cannot say that people are inside those crafts or if they have smooth experience internally it might be just survivable and somehow has some minimal protection.
